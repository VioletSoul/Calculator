**ScienceCalc** is a modern, user-friendly scientific calculator with a rich graphical interface built using Python and Tkinter. It provides a comprehensive suite of mathematical, trigonometric, algebraic, and special scientific functions, supporting advanced operations such as gamma and factorial, work with mathematical constants π, e, φ, c (speed of light), and much more.

## Key Features

- **Arithmetic & Algebra**
    - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, factorial (!), gamma function
    - Built-in constants: π (pi), e (Euler's number), φ (golden ratio), c (speed of light in m/s), ∞ (infinity)

- **Trigonometry (Degrees & Radians)**
    - All standard functions: sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, csc (and inverse functions: arcsin, arccos, arctan)
    - Hyperbolic functions: sinh, cosh, tanh, arcsinh, arccosh, arctanh
    - Convert between degrees and radians: `deg`, `rad`

- **Roots & Logarithms**
    - Square roots (√), cube roots (∛)
    - Exponentiation to base 10 and 2 (10^, 2^)
    - Logarithms: natural (`log`), log base 10 (`log₁₀`), log base 2 (`log₂`), log1p (`ln1p` for log(1+x))

- **Advanced Functions**
    - min, max, average (`avg`), absolute value (`abs`), sign, exp, expm1
    - Insert random number (Rnd)
    - Quick access to scientific constants and notation

- **Modern Intuitive Interface**
    - Stylish UI with color-coded, grouped buttons for numbers, operators, and functions
    - Quick clear (`C`), backspace, sign change (`±`)
    - Robust error handling and expression validation

---

## Interface

A visually modern window with colored button groups for digits, operations, scientific functions, and controls. The expression and results are displayed at the top entry field. Buttons are grouped and color highlighted for easy navigation.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Standard library modules only: `tkinter`, `math`, `random`, `re`, `sys`, `traceback`

---

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Run:  
   `python3 calc.py`

---

## Usage Example

- Enter expressions using the on-screen buttons or keyboard for numbers and functions.
- Supports complex, nested expressions such as:  
  `sin(30) + 5! + √(16) + log₂(8)`
- Press `=` to evaluate and display the result instantly.
